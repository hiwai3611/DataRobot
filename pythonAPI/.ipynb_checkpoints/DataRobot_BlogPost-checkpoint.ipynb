    "Recently, I had the opportunity to explore [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/). As a hardcore pythonic data scientist, I was curious about its capabilities and wondered if it would help expedite my work. DataRobot promises [automated machine learning](https://www.datarobot.com/product/automated-machine-learning/) wherein it chooses the most appropriate machine learning algorithms, automatically optimizes data preprocessing, applies feature engineering, and tunes parameters for each algorithm. It creates and ranks highly accurate [models](https://www.datarobot.com/wiki/model/) and recommends the best model to deploy for the data and prediction target. So when the opportunity to use DataRobot presented itself, I decided to give it a try. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, I have been quite pleased with the functionality and was able to integrate it into my pythonic workflow. I especially like how it internalises all the complexity of AutoML and presents a clean interface to work with while maintaining transparency and explainability. I have consolidated my DataRobot exploration into this tutorial on ***Getting started with using DataRobot python API for multi-class classification***. Hopefully, this will help you understand how DataRobot works and expedite the onboarding process for your data science needs within your enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, I used the [wine quality data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains quality ratings (labels) for 4,898 white wine samples. The features are the wines’ physical and chemical properties (11 predictors). We want to use these physicochemical properties to predict the quality of the wine. Data Robot expects training data in the form of a flat file. For the wine data set used here there was minimal preparation required. You can find the full code for this tutorial on [github](https://github.com/shaheeng/DataRobot/blob/master/pythonAPI/Getting_started_with_using_DataRobot_pythonAPI.ipynb) for intermediate steps. To access the DataRobot modeling engine, it is necessary to establish an authenticated [connection](https://datarobot-public-api-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/v2.15.0/setup/getting_started.html). With the training data prepared and connection established through my python session I will create three different projects to showcase the three different modes DataRobot can work with on my data. The three modes are the full autopilot mode, the quick autopilot mode and the manual mode. I will call the three projects corresponding to the three modes project_wine1, project_wine2, and project_wine3. Once the training process is complete, I will show how to retrieve the results from the various models and how to generate predictions on new data using a selected model. "
